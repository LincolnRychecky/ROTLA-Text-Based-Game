# Raiders of the Lost Arc Tangent

Created by : **Ankur Sharma** and **Lincoln Rychecky**

Java Version Used : **Java 18**


This project implements the game **Raiders of the Lost Arctangent**, a text based game simulation that makes use of various design patterns all implemented in Java. The RotLAGameSimulation class implements the game and delegates the processing of the game to GameEngine. This iteration of the game requires user input in the form of move, fight, search, or celebrate depending upon the potential actions available on a given turn per the instructions

The turn by turn output log files for the single run are present in the logs folder in the base directory.

The single game terminal output capture file SingleGameRun.txt is available in the base directory

Assumption: We made the assumption that a user could only direct their character to move, but not the specific directtion in which to move. We allow the user to specify move, with results in the character moving to a randomly seected room connected to their current room

An updated UML diagram for the project can be found in the Project_4.2_UML.pdf located in the base directory
